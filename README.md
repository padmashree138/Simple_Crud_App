hi, I made a simple crud app and here are some thing I topics along : 

1. Include a "serve" script in package.json
2. Creating a .gitignore file to exclude node_modules.
3. Connecting to MongoDB and creating a schema/model for a product in the CRUD API.
4. Use of Insomania and Postman for testing the API.
5.  Demonstrating how to test each operation.
6. Implementing CRUD operations such as Create, Read, Update and Delete for the product API using Express and MongoDB
